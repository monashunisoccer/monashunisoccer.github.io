Below is a reverse chronological listing of the "best clubman/club person" award winners, 
as well any Monash University SC life member inductions of that year (see also Life Members page).

Please note that the data for some seasons is incomplete, and the club
strongly encourages anyone with any additional information to contact the club.

The 'Eric Chan Best Clubman Award' was awarded each year from 1979 to 2004.
Club icon Tommy Rice tops the winners of this award having been recognised a record 4 times.

In 2005, in order to celebrate the joining of the mens and womens 
clubs, a new 'Club Person of the Year' award was created, named 
for long time club stalwart Tim Smurthwaite.
